# bandwidth-overlay
It's a simple bandwidth overlay that shows download and upload speed, as well as ping if it exceeds a certain limit, in red text. Useful in online games to track the network and also useful if there's anyone using the internet in the background.

You can drag the overlay anywhere you want. To set the overlay in a locked position, double-click on the overlay text—it will lock and create a position.cfg file where the .py file exists.

I recommend saving all files in one folder.
Change the path of the .py file to where you saved it.

Please read the overlay_usage_guide—it's important.
